# Tasks

A solution containing solved problems for the "Parallel Programming" course.

Each task is designed as a set of related projects located in the corresponding folder **Task[n]**.

Full description of the tasks is [here](/Common/Tasks.pdf).

## [Task1](./Task1)

Parallel implementation of Prim's algorithm with MPI technology in C# (using MPI.NET).

## [Task2](./Task2)

Implementation of simplified (unbounded buffer) producer-consumer problem in C# using atomic operations for synchronization.

## [Task3](./Task3)

ThreadPool implementation in C# with support of **Work Stealing** and **Work Sharing** scheduling strategies and task continuation.

## [Task4](./Task4)

Exam system implemented in C#, supporting 2 types of concurrent set and providing web API on ASP.NET.
